- en: We depend on hashing, encryption, and digital signatures every day. Of these
    three, encryption typically steals the show. It gets more attention at conferences,
    in lecture halls, and from mainstream media. Programmers are generally more interested
    in learning about it as well.

- en: This first part of the book repeatedly demonstrates why hashing and digital
    signatures are as vital as encryption. Moreover, the subsequent parts of the book
    demonstrate the importance of all three. Therefore, chapters 2 through 6 are useful
    by themselves, but they also help you understand many of the later chapters.
