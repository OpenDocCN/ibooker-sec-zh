- en: 'This second part of the book is the most commercially useful. I say this because
    it is loaded with hands-on examples of workflows that most systems need to have:
    registering and authenticating users, managing user sessions, changing and resetting
    passwords, administering permissions and group membership, as well as sharing
    resources. This portion of the book is focused primarily on getting work done,
    securely.'
