- en: Unlike parts 1 and 2, part 3 isn’t primarily concerned with fundamentals or
    development. Instead, everything revolves around Mallory as she devastates the
    other characters with attacks such as cross-site scripting, open redirect attacks,
    SQL injection, cross-site request forgery, clickjacking, and more. This is the
    most adversarial portion of the book. In each chapter, attacks don’t complement
    the main idea; attacks *are* the main idea.
