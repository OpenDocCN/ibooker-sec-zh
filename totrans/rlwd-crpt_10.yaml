    of most of what you’ve learned in the first part. Think about it this way: if
    the cryptographic primitives you’ve learned about were the basic ingredients of
    cryptography, you’re now about to learn some recipes. And there’s a lot to cook!
    While Caesar might have only been interested in encrypting his communications,
    today cryptography is all over the place, and it’s quite hard to keep track of
    it all.'

- en: In chapter 9, 10, and 11, I show you where you are most likely to run into cryptography
    and how cryptography is used to solve real-world problems; that is, how cryptography
    encrypts communications and how it authenticates participants in protocols. For
    the most part, that’s what cryptography is about. Participants will be numerous
    or few, and made of bits or flesh. As you’ll quickly realize, real-world cryptography
    is about tradeoffs and, based on the context, solutions will differ.

- en: 'Chapter 12 and 13 take you into two quickly evolving fields of cryptography:
    cryptocurrencies and hardware cryptography. The former topic has been ignored
    by most books on cryptography. (I believe that this book, *Real-World Cryptography*,
    is the first cryptography book to include a chapter on cryptocurrencies.) The
    latter topic, hardware cryptography, is often overlooked too; cryptographers often
    assume that their primitives and protocols run in a trusted environment, which
    is less and less the case. Hardware cryptography is about pushing the boundaries
    of where cryptography can run and providing security assurances when attackers
    are getting closer and closer to you.'

    will be and what’s sort of here. You’ll learn about postquantum cryptography,
    which is a field of cryptography that might be useful, depending on if we, as
    a human species, invent scalable quantum computers. These quantum computers, based
    on novel paradigms coming from the realm of quantum physics, could revolutionize
    research and, perhaps, even break our crypto . . . You’ll also learn about what
    I call “next-generation cryptography,” cryptographic primitives that have rarely
    seen the light of day but that you will most likely see more frequently as these
    get studied, become more efficient, and get adopted by application designers.
    Finally, I conclude the book in chapter 16 with some final remarks on real-world
    cryptography and some words on ethics.'
