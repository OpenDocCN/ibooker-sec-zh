- en: 'You are now entering the second part of this book, which is going to make use
    of most of what you’ve learned in the first part. Think about it this way: if
    the cryptographic primitives you’ve learned about were the basic ingredients of
    cryptography, you’re now about to learn some recipes. And there’s a lot to cook!
    While Caesar might have only been interested in encrypting his communications,
    today cryptography is all over the place, and it’s quite hard to keep track of
    it all.'

  zh: 你现在要进入本书的第二部分，这一部分将充分利用你在第一部分学到的知识。可以这样理解：如果你在第一部分学到的密码学原语是密码学的基本成分，那么你现在要学习的就是一些配方。而要做的菜有很多！虽然凯撒大帝可能只对加密他的通信感兴趣，但如今的密码学无处不在，要跟踪这一切是相当困难的。
- en: In chapter 9, 10, and 11, I show you where you are most likely to run into cryptography
    and how cryptography is used to solve real-world problems; that is, how cryptography
    encrypts communications and how it authenticates participants in protocols. For
    the most part, that’s what cryptography is about. Participants will be numerous
    or few, and made of bits or flesh. As you’ll quickly realize, real-world cryptography
    is about tradeoffs and, based on the context, solutions will differ.

  zh: 在第 9、10 和 11 章中，我会告诉你最有可能遇到密码学的地方以及密码学是如何用于解决现实问题的；也就是说，密码学是如何加密通信以及如何对协议参与者进行认证的。在很大程度上，这就是密码学的内容。参与者可能众多也可能少数，由比特或者血肉构成。你很快就会意识到，现实世界的密码学涉及到各种权衡，并且根据不同的背景，解决方案也会有所不同。
- en: 'Chapter 12 and 13 take you into two quickly evolving fields of cryptography:
    cryptocurrencies and hardware cryptography. The former topic has been ignored
    by most books on cryptography. (I believe that this book, *Real-World Cryptography*,
    is the first cryptography book to include a chapter on cryptocurrencies.) The
    latter topic, hardware cryptography, is often overlooked too; cryptographers often
    assume that their primitives and protocols run in a trusted environment, which
    is less and less the case. Hardware cryptography is about pushing the boundaries
    of where cryptography can run and providing security assurances when attackers
    are getting closer and closer to you.'

  zh: 第 12 和 13 章带你进入两个迅速发展的密码学领域：加密货币和硬件密码学。前者的话题被大多数密码学书籍所忽视。（我相信这本书，《现实世界的密码学》，是第一本包含加密货币章节的密码学书籍。）后者，硬件密码学，也经常被忽视；密码学家常常假设他们的原语和协议在受信任的环境中运行，而这种情况越来越少见。硬件密码学是关于推动密码学运行的边界，并在攻击者越来越接近你的时候提供安全保障。
- en: 'In chapters 14 and 15, I touch on the bleeding edge: what’s not here yet but
    will be and what’s sort of here. You’ll learn about postquantum cryptography,
    which is a field of cryptography that might be useful, depending on if we, as
    a human species, invent scalable quantum computers. These quantum computers, based
    on novel paradigms coming from the realm of quantum physics, could revolutionize
    research and, perhaps, even break our crypto . . . You’ll also learn about what
    I call “next-generation cryptography,” cryptographic primitives that have rarely
    seen the light of day but that you will most likely see more frequently as these
    get studied, become more efficient, and get adopted by application designers.
    Finally, I conclude the book in chapter 16 with some final remarks on real-world
    cryptography and some words on ethics.'

  zh: 在第 14 和第 15 章中，我涉及到了最前沿的内容：还未出现但即将出现的内容以及现阶段已经存在的内容。你将了解到后量子密码学，这是一个取决于我们作为人类是否发明出可扩展的量子计算机而可能有用的密码学领域。这些基于量子物理领域新范式的量子计算机可能会彻底改变研究，并且，也许甚至会打破我们的加密……
    你还将了解到我所称之为“下一代密码学”的内容，这些密码学原语很少被使用，但随着这些原语被研究、变得更加高效并被应用设计者采用，你很可能会更频繁地看到它们。最后，在第
    16 章中，我就现实世界的密码学做了一些最终的备注，并就伦理问题发表了一些看法。
