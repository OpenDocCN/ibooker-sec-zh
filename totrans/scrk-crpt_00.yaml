    hiding and discovering information within other information have long compelled
    the intellect. Cryptology is a fascinating subject with which almost every schoolchild
    has some hands-on familiarity. And yet, for good reasons, it is a discipline that
    throughout time has been shrouded in the deepest levels of secrecy and used by
    governments to protect their most sensitive weapons. Cryptography’s role in military
    and diplomatic affairs has always been deadly serious. It is no exaggeration to
    declare that successes and failures of cryptography have shaped the outcome of
    wars and the course of history; nor is it an exaggeration to state that the successes
    and failures of cryptography are setting our current course of history.

    George McClellan commanded the Union forces against Robert E. Lee’s Confederate
    forces near Sharpsburg, Maryland. A few days earlier, two Union soldiers had found
    a piece of paper near their camp, which turned out to be a copy of an order issued
    by Lee detailing his plans for the invasion of Maryland. The order had not been
    encrypted. With the information it contained, McClellan precisely knew the location
    of the commands of Lee’s scattered army and was able to destroy Lee’s army before
    they reunited.

    The terrible Russian failure at Tannenberg in August 1914 was the direct result
    of the German army’s intercept of Russian communications. Amazingly, the Russian
    communications were totally in the clear because the Russians had not equipped
    their field commanders with ciphers and keys. The Russians were thus unable to
    securely coordinate the activities of neighboring units within each army.

    cryptographic failure, this time on the Japanese at the Battle of Midway in 1942\.
    American cryptanalysts broke the Japanese codes and were reading many of the messages
    of the Combined Fleet. Stories like these are within the purview of classical
    cryptography. *Secret Key Cryptography* plays in this sandbox.

    with my high school friend Charlie Rose. Charlie worked in the school bookstore.
    One day, while ordering books for the store, he noticed the book *Cryptanalysis*
    by Helen F. Gaines. Charlie wanted the book, and he also wanted the employee discount.
    But there was a hitch. The minimum order the store could place was three copies.

    would all read the book together, then make up cryptograms that the others would
    solve. I bought the book, read it, and made up cryptograms, but Charlie had lost
    interest.

    they published in their hobbyist newsletter, *The Cryptogram*, and after a few
    years I became an assistant editor. I remained a member for over 40 years.

    I started reading the articles, then contributing articles, and then became an
    editor. Somehow I became the “crackpot handler.” Those articles all came to me,
    and I had to find my way through the illogical logic to see if a good idea was
    hidden inside. In just one case there was. I turned that into an article for *The
    Cryptogram*. The author was so grateful he planted a tree in Israel in my honor.

    written or where the author had simply overestimated the strength of the cipher

    a weak cipher can describe the cipher and write out the steps. The true crackpots
    cannot get their vague and grandiose imaginings onto paper. They can write reams
    about how wonderful their ciphers are, but they cannot write out the steps. They
    cannot turn their inchoate thoughts into a concrete algorithm.'

    He worked for 28 years at IBM in the design automation field, where he designed
    and wrote specialized software that IBM engineers used to design computers and
    circuits. He is the owner of Master Software Corp. which produces cryptographic
    software. Frank has been issued four U.S. patents on cryptographic methods. Frank
    has about 50 papers published in refereed journals on cryptography, computer circuits,
    graph theory and pure mathematics, plus several books (user manuals and project
    specifications) published internally at IBM. In cryptography he is best known
    for solving the Jefferson Cypher Wheel. In computer science Frank is best known
    for arithmetic coding, now one of the standard methods for text compression, and
    for his algorithm for finding Hamilton paths. In pure mathematics he is probably
    best known for introducing the concept of a finite-state recognizer to measure
    theory. Frank has three published books of Sudoku puzzles and two self-published
    books of SumSum puzzles. He is the author of more than 3,500 puzzles published
    in *The Cryptogram, Technology Review*, and *Journal of Recreational Mathematics*,
    and he is the only person ever honored by having a special issue of *JRM* dedicated
    entirely to his own puzzles.
