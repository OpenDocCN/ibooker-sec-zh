- en: I have been doing cryptography for more than 50 years. I have learned a great
    deal in that time. In this book I try to pass along that knowledge to the next
    generation of cryptographers. Much of this is new discoveries, not found anywhere
    else in the literature.

    to read my book, I need to offer ideas that other books don’t have, ideas other
    authors don’t know, or believe are impossible. I need to make the book ***SENSATIONAL***.
    Here goes. I will

    author, working together, cooperating to solve a problem or to guard a secret.

    ideas when I know the sources, and dates as close as I can remember them, but
    much of what I have learned was acquired informally. There is little in the way
    of references, footnotes or erudite exegesis. This is written to be a practical
    book. Follow its recommendations, and you will produce a secure cipher. Guaranteed.

    and partly to set the historic record straight. I know a heavy subject like cryptography
    can be hard going. I hope the use of first person, the little anecdotes and a
    bit of humor make it easier to absorb.

    and methods for cracking ciphers that have never been published before. There
    are even a few of my own mathematical discoveries. You can find them only in this
    book. There are lots of practical tips on how to do stuff, and a few computer
    methods to do things faster or using less storage.

    that you need to keep secret against opponents who could have supercomputers,
    or even quantum computers. This book tells you how. I provide a toolbox of methods,
    both new and historical, that can be combined in myriad ways to make arbitrarily
    strong ciphers. Cryptography students and developers will find the broadest possible
    range of practical methods that can be used to develop new cryptographic products
    and services.

    hobbyists alike. There are plenty of methods that can be done by hand using only
    paper and pencil. You can find such a method at the end of section 9.6.1\. These
    methods are suitable for field use, when electricity and electronic devices may
    be unavailable. There are even a few ciphers that children can use.

    If you can read and understand this book, or even half of it, then you can create
    an unbreakable cipher. The book teaches anyone who has the desire how to construct
    a cipher that will stand up to a serious attack by trained cryptographers with
    supercomputers. No other book does that. In fact, you can develop your own secure
    cipher using only paper-and-pencil methods. I build up a large inventory of methods
    and concepts starting with historical ciphers from the 15th century onward, and
    teach you what combinations reinforce your ciphers, and which are merely wasted
    effort. I am going to give you an armory of tried-and-true techniques plus fresh-and-new
    techniques that you can use to build an impregnable fortress.'

    occupation, so I tend to use mathematical notation and mathematical concepts liberally.
    This book is intended for a broader audience, not just engineers and scientists.
    I will try to explain all of the needed math so that the book is self-contained.
    If you understand subscripts and exponents, and you can read expressions containing
    parentheses, that is about as much math background as you will need. I explain
    all of the math beyond that, such as prime numbers, modular arithmetic, and, for
    the more advanced chapters, matrix arithmetic and mathematical rings.'

    related cryptographic method. There are still plenty of methods. Some are sure
    to fit your needs.'

    with how much you learn. Don’t be discouraged if you don’t understand some topic.
    You may find the next one easy. Even professional mathematicians don’t understand
    every topic.
