    variations. This may bewilder some readers. They may want to know just one thing:
    ‚ÄúWhat is the best cipher for me?‚Äù That question is complicated, because the book
    is intended for such a wide range of readers. In this epilogue I hope to provide
    some useful answers.'

- en: '**Children**: There are several ciphers here that children can understand and
    use. They can use simple substitution ciphers, especially the Caesar cipher. Children
    particularly like ciphers where the letters are replaced by pictures or symbols,
    such as üôÇ‚òΩ‚ô°‚öá‚öìüéæüßô‚òº‚óà‚òÜ. Children also like route transpositions. Teens may like columnar
    transpositions and the Belaso cipher.'

    one another to solve them. Ciphers that are best suited for this are simple substitution,
    polyalphabetic substitution, autokey, running key, Playfair, bifid, diagonal bifid,
    trifid, Two Square, route transposition, columnar transposition, Bazeries, and
    fractionated Morse.'

    where they can submit their ciphers for other members to solve, and solve the
    cryptograms that other members have submitted. Their webpage [https://www.cryptogram.org/resource-area/cipher-types/](https://www.cryptogram.org/resource-area/cipher-types/)
    has a list of the cipher types they accept.

- en: '**Developers**: People who want to develop or invent their own ciphers will
    find scores of methods here, which can be combined in myriad ways. Letters can
    be replaced by other letters, or by fixed-length or variable-length groups of
    bits, Morse symbols, digits in any number base, or elements of a mathematical
    ring. All of these may be transposed and regrouped. Groups may be substituted
    again, compressed, multiplied by large integers or by matrices, converted into
    other number bases, or chained together. Parts of some groups may be used to encipher
    parts of other groups.'

- en: '**Crypto service providers**: Companies that provide encrypted communication
    services typically use their own proprietary algorithms. They may use any of the
    techniques just listed for developers, but they must ensure that their cipher
    meets all of the criteria of chapter 12\. The cipher should have large blocks
    and long keys. It should be highly non-linear, and have good diffusion and saturation.'

- en: If the service provider uses a standard algorithm such as 3DES or AES, then
    the standard cipher should be preceded and followed by a keyed secret substitution
    or a keyed secret transposition.

    communications so that they can interchange information among themselves, as well
    as with the Federal Reserve, the SEC, the IRS and other government agencies. Banks
    also make wide use of public key cryptography to establish encryption keys and
    for authentication and verification.'

- en: '**Military and diplomatic**: The US military and State Department are mandated
    by NSA regulations to use 256-bit AES. This has the force of law. This is done
    on PCs, laptops and even smartphones with an AES chip, or with AES software. However,
    the military and the intelligence services operate in places and conditions where
    computers and cell phones may not work, or where a phone equipped with AES would
    be suspicious or illegal. Possession of any form of cryptographic equipment, literature
    or work product is illegal in many countries. Additionally, foreign armies and
    diplomatic corps may distrust any AES hardware or software, all of which can come
    only from the NSA or suppliers regulated by the NSA.'

    to back up their electronic cryptographic equipment. Hand ciphers suitable for
    use in combat conditions include diagonal bifid, TwoSquare+1, Two Square ripple,
    and Playfair TwoSquare. Another idea is to use bifid or Two Square followed by
    a piecewise transposition.

- en: '**Large files**: For very large files it is much faster to use a stream cipher
    rather than a block cipher. You generate a stream of pseudorandom numbers and
    combine this with the data file to simulate a one-time pad. You can use Xorshift,
    FRand or Gen5 for the PRNG, and you can use **xors**, **adds** or **poly** for
    the combining function. Or, you could use GenX for both generating and combining.'
